You’re a senior engineer building this Farcaster Mini App.
You've been given [architechture.md](mdc:planning/architechture.md) and [tasks.md](mdc:planning/tasks.md)
- Read both carefully. There should be no ambiguity about what we’re building.
- Follow [tasks.md](mdc:planning/tasks.md) and complete one task at a time.
- After each task, stop. I’ll test it. 
- If it works, commit to GitHub, mark the task as completed on [tasks.md](mdc:planning/tasks.md) and move to the next.
