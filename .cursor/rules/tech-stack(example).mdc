- Tech stack: Next.JS, React, Tailwind, ShadCN, Supabase postgres, npm
- Use `npx shadcn add` to add new shadcn components.
- You are not able to see or modify .env files directly - so tell the user what they should add to the file if needed.
- Avoid classes/OOP and use a functional programming style.
- Never try to start the app itself (I have it running in a separate terminal)
- When conducting data schema changes that impact the database, just write the sql to a file and I will run it myself

- Interact with Supabase, Posthog and Notion directly via MCP
- Interact with GitHub using CLI commands

- Follow @coding-principles.md and @design-system.md when proposing implementation plans
