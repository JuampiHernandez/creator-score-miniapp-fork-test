# Cursor Rules for Automatic Changelog Generation

## Single-operation flow (DO THIS)

When package.json version changes:

1) Extract version ‚Üí vX.Y (ignore patch)
2) Prepare content (summary + detailed changelog) and show for approval
3) After approval, perform ONE atomic create-or-update in the Product Changelog database:
   - Parent database ID: d8921ac6c484431dad428039279898aa (Product Changelog)
   - Create if no entry exists with Version = vX.Y and App = "Creator Score"; otherwise update that entry
   - Set properties in the same operation:
     - Title: "Creator Score vX.Y" (include app name prefix)
     - App: "Creator Score"
     - Version: "vX.Y"
     - Release Date (UTC): today ‚Üí set `date:Release Date:start`
     - Summary: generated one-liner
   - Set page icon: default üéÅ (gift). Alternatives: üé† (carousel), üíé (perks), üèÜ (winners)
   - Insert the full changelog content as the page body

4) Post-create verification (no manual steps):
   - Ensure the page exists under the Product Changelog database (not as a standalone page)
   - Properties (App, Version, Release Date, Summary) are populated
   - Return the created/updated page URL in chat

Notes:
- Never create a standalone page; always use the database parent_id.
- Always default Release Date to UTC unless a different date is specified.
- If a duplicate vX.Y exists for ‚ÄúCreator Score,‚Äù update instead of creating.
- Do not include the Summary in the page content body; Summary is a page property only.

## Package.json Version Monitoring
When I modify package.json and change the version field:

1. **Extract version info:**
   - Read the new version from package.json
   - Extract only the major.minor (X.Y) part, ignore patch (Z)
   - Format as "vX.Y" (e.g., "v2.1")

2. **Check for existing entry:**
   - Search the Notion "Product Changelog" database for entries with "App" property: "Creator Score" OR entries with name starting with "Creator Score v"
   - Database URL: https://www.notion.so/talentprotocol/d8921ac6c484431dad428039279898aa
   - Use Notion MCP search tool to check if entry already exists

3. **Analyze changes and generate content:**
   - Review git commits since the last version tag/release
   - Analyze code changes, PR descriptions, and commit messages
   - Generate a concise one-line summary for the "Summary" property on Notion
   - Create detailed changelog content organized by category
   - Present the generated content for validation before creation

4. **Validate generated content with user:**
   - Present the generated changelog content:
     - Version: vX.Y
     - App: Creator Score
     - Release Date: today's date
     - Summary: (AI-generated one-line summary)
     - Full changelog: (AI-generated detailed content)
   - Ask if the content looks accurate and complete
   - Allow me to request edits or approve as-is
   - Wait for confirmation before proceeding

5. **Create new changelog entry (after approval):**
   - Only create if no existing entry found for this version AND user approves content
   - Use Notion template: https://www.notion.so/talentprotocol/Product-Changelog-24afc9bb5319804ea688edc6dcc33642?p=24afc9bb5319801e9820c52e24d5d694
   - Set properties:
     - App: "Creator Score"
     - Version: "vX.Y" (extracted version)
     - Release Date: today's date
     - Summary: (AI-generated summary)
   - Use AI-generated content instead of template placeholders
   - Also pick an appropriate icon/emoji for each changelog entry

6. **Use Notion template for content:**
   - Duplicate the template page: https://www.notion.so/talentprotocol/Product-Changelog-24afc9bb5319804ea688edc6dcc33642?p=24afc9bb5319801e9820c52e24d5d694
   - Update the duplicated page with the correct properties
   - Or create new page with template structure if duplication not available

7. **Post-creation:**
   - Confirm the entry was created successfully
   - Provide the direct link to edit the new changelog entry
   - Remind me to fill in the actual changes in the template sections

8. **Use Notion template with AI content:**
   - Duplicate the template page or create new page with template structure
   - Replace template placeholders with AI-generated content
   - Organize changes into appropriate sections (New Features, Bug Fixes, etc.)

9. **Post-creation:**
   - Confirm the entry was created successfully
   - Provide the direct link to the new changelog entry
   - Note that the content was AI-generated and can be edited if needed

## Content Generation Guidelines:
- **Summary**: One concise sentence describing the main theme of the release
- Do not duplicate the Summary inside the page content; keep it as a property only.
- **Changelog sections**:
  - Analyze commit messages and code changes
  - Group changes by type: New Features, Bug Fixes, Improvements, Breaking Changes
  - Use clear, user-facing language (not technical implementation details)
  - Focus on what users/stakeholders will notice
  - Include only significant changes (ignore minor refactoring, typos, etc.)

## Validation Flow Example:
```
üîÑ Version bump detected: 2.1.0 ‚Üí 2.2.0

üìä Analyzing changes since v2.1...
   ‚Ä¢ Found 12 commits
   ‚Ä¢ Identified 3 new features, 5 bug fixes, 2 improvements

üìù Generated changelog content:

Summary: "Added user authentication system and improved overall application performance"

## New Features
- Implemented OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub
- Added user profile management dashboard
- Introduced dark mode toggle

## Bug Fixes  
- Fixed memory leak in data processing pipeline
- Resolved UI rendering issues on mobile devices
- Corrected timezone handling in date calculations

## Improvements
- Optimized database queries for 40% faster load times
- Enhanced error messaging throughout the application

‚úÖ Does this content look accurate? (y/n/edit)
```

## Manual Command
Also support a manual command "Create changelog entry" that:
- Asks for the version if not clear from package.json
- Analyzes changes since the last version
- Generates summary and changelog content automatically
- Follows the same validation flow
- Uses the same template and process

## Error Handling
- If git history is not available, ask me to provide change information manually
- If no significant changes detected, ask if I still want to create an entry
- If Notion MCP is not available, show clear error message with setup instructions
- If database is not accessible, provide the database URL and check permissions
- If template is not accessible, fall back to basic template structure
- If version extraction fails, ask me to specify the version manually
- If user requests edits during validation, allow iterative refinement
- If user cancels during validation, stop the process gracefully

## Notes
- Only trigger on actual version changes, not other package.json modifications
- Always use "Creator Score" as the app name
- Never create duplicate entries for the same X.Y version
- Always validate generated content with user before creating entries
- Focus on user-facing changes, not internal refactoring
- Use clear, non-technical language in changelog entries
- Template URL: https://www.notion.so/talentprotocol/Product-Changelog-24afc9bb5319804ea688edc6dcc33642?p=24afc9bb5319801e9820c52e24d5d694
