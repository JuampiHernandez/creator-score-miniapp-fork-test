## TASK

- Design a modern mobile-first UI for a web app for content creators called Creator Rewards.
- The app has a clean, minimal design with a white background and strategic use of cards only where needed

## CONTEXT & CONSTRAINTS
 
- We're in design mode. We're not going to be building any backend functionality or business logic. We're just going to use dummy JSON in order to mock up the prototype of our mini app and show the intended behavior.
- Focus just on mobile screens (ignore desktop / responsive for now)

## LAYOUT & NAVIGATION

- 4 main pages: Rewards, Search, Profile, Settings
- Fixed top navigation bar (TopNav) with app title and hamburger menu
- Bottom navigation bar (BottomNav) with minimal icons for switching screens.


## DESIGN SYSTEM & GUIDELINES

- **Minimalist, mobile-first layout**: optimized for mobile viewing with appropriate touch targets and plenty of white space; on desktop, the app centers its mobile-style content in a fixed-width column, hides the bottom navigation bar, and relies on the top header for navigation.
- **Neutral colors**: White background, dark text, soft shadows and subtle borders
- **Modular components**: use shadcn/ui components and Lucide React icons as default; all UI elements are modular, reusable, and follow a consistent visual hierarchy; 
- **Clean typography**: Clear hierarchy with bold names, subtle secondary text in modern sans-serif font
- **Interactive elements**: Hover states, smooth transitions, expandable sections
- **Loading & Error States**: skeleton screens for loading + graceful error messages and retry options
