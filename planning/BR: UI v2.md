## TASK

- Design and implement the frontend for "Builder Rewards," a mobile-first Farcaster mini app. 
- The application must feature a clean, minimalist UI, allowing users to track their onchain development rewards, view leaderboards, manage their public profile, and configure personal settings.

## CONTEXT & CONSTRAINTS

-   **Application:** Builder Rewards, a Farcaster Frame v2.
-   **Target Platform:** Mobile-first.
-   **Core Idea:** Distribute weekly rewards to onchain developers based on verified crypto activity (GitHub, smart contracts) and a "Builder Score." No need to apply, post, or claim; rewards are automatic.
-   **Key UI Principles:** Clean, minimalist, intuitive, and responsive.
-   **Focus:** This prompt focuses on the UI/UX (what the user sees and interacts with) rather than deep technical implementation details.

## LAYOUT & NAVIGATION

### 1. Global Navigation Elements

-   **Top Navigation Bar:**
    -   Displays "Builder Rewards" title.
    -   Menu icon (right side) opens a draggable bottom sheet (Menu Modal).
-   **Bottom Navigation Bar:**
    -   Fixed at the bottom.
    -   Provides primary navigation to four main pages: 'Rewards', 'Search', 'Profile', 'Settings'.
    -   The active page icon and label are visually highlighted (e.g., blue icon/text with a light blue background).

### 2. Modal Navigation & Behavior

-   **Menu Modal (Draggable Bottom Sheet):**
    -   Accessed from the Top Navigation Bar's menu icon.
    -   Navigation links: "Settings," "About" (opens About Modal), "Dev Docs" (external link), "Support" (external link), and "Log Out."
    -   Footer: Copyright information and social media icons/links (T&C, X/Twitter, Discord, Farcaster).
-   **About Modal (Draggable Bottom Sheet):**
    -   Accessed from the Menu Modal.
    -   Includes a "Back" button to return to the Menu Modal.
    -   Content sections:
        -   "Builder Rewards": App description.
        -   "How it works": Bullet-point explanation.
        -   "Supported Networks": Visual badges (e.g., Base, Celo, Talent).
        -   "About Talent Protocol": Brief description.
-   **General Modal Behavior:**
    -   All modals appearing as bottom sheets (Menu, About, Eligibility, Score Breakdown, Hall of Fame, Wallet Menu, Profile Modal) are draggable downwards to close.
    -   These draggable sheets feature a small, horizontal gray dash at the top center as a visual drag handle.

## DESIGN SYSTEM & GUIDELINES

-   **Mobile-First Design:** UI must be optimized for mobile viewing and touch interaction.
-   **Clean & Minimalist Aesthetic:**
    -   Emphasize clarity through ample white space.
    -   Use legible typography suitable for mobile screens.
    -   Employ a restrained color palette. Blue should be the primary accent color for interactive elements, highlights, and key information.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:**
    -   Utilize reusable UI components (Cards, Buttons, Badges, Progress Bars, Tabs, Select Dropdowns, Avatars, Inputs, Checkboxes, Labels, etc.) for consistency.
    -   Adhere to shadcn/ui component styling principles where applicable.
-   **Interactivity & Feedback:**
    -   All interactive elements (buttons, links, tabs, etc.) must have clear visual feedback for hover and active/pressed states.
-   **Iconography:**
    -   Use Lucide React icons consistently for actions, information, and visual cues.
    -   Ensure icons are appropriately sized and styled for a mobile context, maintaining visual balance.
-   **Consistency:**
    -   Maintain uniformity in font sizes, spacing, padding, border styles, icon usage, and component appearance throughout the application.
    -   Pay attention to consistent sizing and styling for elements like icons and text within similar components across different pages (e.g., icons in Accounts tab vs. Projects tab on the Profile page).

## PAGE STRUCTURE

### 1. Rewards Page

-   **Selectors & Filters:**
    -   Dropdown: 'Sponsor' (e.g., Base, Celo, Talent).
    -   Dropdown: 'Status' (displays user's eligibility for the selected sponsor).

    -   Tabs: 'Period' selection ("This Week," "Last Week," "All Time").
        -   "This Week" tab should have a visual indicator (e.g., a green pulsing dot) signifying it's current.

    -   **Aggregate Stats (Contextual):**
        -   If 'This Week': "Round Ends" (e.g., "3d 14h") and "Total Rewards" in the pool. These cards also feature the green pulsing dot.
